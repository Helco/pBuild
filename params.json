{"name":"pBuild","tagline":"A tool for building pebble projects in Travis CI.","body":"# pBuild for Travis-CI\r\nPebbleBuild is a tool for building pebble projects in Travis CI.\r\nIt is really useful when using the Pebble SDK.\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n1. To install pBuild, copy .travis.yml, before_install.sh, and build.sh to your pebble app's github repository.  Make sure the two .sh files are marked executable, using `git update-index --chmod=+x` if necessary.\r\n2. Then go to travis, go into your repoditory (in Travis) and go to Settings -> Settings and into Enviromental Variables. \r\n3. Add new enviromental variables: `PEBBLE_SDK=PebbleSDK-3.4` (this is the pebble sdk version to use for compilation) and check \"Display value in build logs\", and `PEBBLE_PROJECT_PATH=[RepoOwnerUsername]/[RepoName]/[PebbleProjectPathinRepo]` (Only add the PebbleProjectPathinRepo if needed). Example: `PEBBLE_PROJECT_PATH=sGerli/pBuild` (this one is case sensitive) and check \"Display value in build logs\"\r\n\r\n## Settings\r\n* Pebble Analytics are on for default. If you want to disable it in before_install.sh modify the 8th line and change `touch ~/pebble-dev/ENABLE_ANALYTICS` to `touch ~/pebble-dev/NO_TRACKING`\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting\r\n1. If a resource is not found, check its path because it's case sensitive.\r\n2. If you get any other build script error add an issue.\r\n3. If you get a error that isn't be general, send a email to support@igerli.com.\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n* Stefano Gerli (@sGerli)\r\n* Ben Combee (@unwiredben)\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\npBuild is based on [Sawyer Pangborn's travis-ci-pebble](https://github.com/spangborn/travis-ci-pebble)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
